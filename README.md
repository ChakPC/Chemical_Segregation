# Chemical_Segregation
This is a basic Machine Learning problem using Logistic Regression

The problem statement is that we have to do binary classification of unknown chemicals based on their three numerical features.

Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which works out a best fit line on the basis of training data. The Class of Testing
data is based on the side in which it is of the worked out line. The line can be naturally multi-dimemsional and is such a line that
the probability of a known data(training data) to belong to its class is maximised. This algorithm may also be extended for classification
problems involving more than two classes.
